★ Hashimoto-sama's exclusive challenge to join the company ★<br>
(1) Write code to scrape arxiv.org treatises (Abstract is at least as good as reading the text)<br>
(2) Expand so that you can search arxiv.org articles with any keyword.<br>
(3) Also support bioarxiv.org<br>

Implement the above problem (1) on the sampling page<br>
There are many unclear points due to my lack of understanding, and I plan to correct the code again after the question and answer session.<br>
